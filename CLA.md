# 🌙 **MayMeow Studio – Contributor License Agreement (Hybrid Edition)**

*Version 1.0*

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **MayMeow Studio**.
This Agreement explains how contributions can be accepted while protecting both you and the project.
I’ve kept it simple, fair, and respectful — no corporate legalese.

---

## **1. You Keep Ownership of Your Work**

You remain the **copyright holder** of everything you contribute.
Submitting a contribution does **not** transfer your ownership, rights, or attribution.

You are simply giving MayMeow Studio permission to include your work in the project.

---

## **2. Your Contribution Must Be Yours**

By contributing, you confirm that:

1. Your work is your own original creation, **or**
2. You have the right and permission to submit it under this Agreement, **and**
3. You are not violating anyone else’s rights.

If your contribution includes third-party content, you confirm you have the proper rights to use it.

---

## **3. License Grant**

You grant MayMeow Studio a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free** license to:

* use and reproduce your contribution,
* modify and improve it,
* publish and distribute it,
* include it in project releases,
* sublicense it under the project’s open-source license.

This license is required so your work can legally be part of the project.

You still keep full ownership.

---

## **4. Open-Source License Alignment**

Your contribution will be distributed under the **same open-source license** used by the project (for example MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL, etc.).

This ensures the project stays consistent and transparent.

---

## **5. No Warranty**

Your contribution is provided **“as-is”**, without warranties or guarantees.
This protects contributors from unexpected legal responsibility — standard for open source.

---

## **6. Privacy-Friendly Contribution Verification**

MayMeow Studio uses **SHA-256 hashes of GitHub usernames** to verify CLA approval.

This system ensures:

* no real names are stored
* no emails are stored
* no GitHub profile links are stored
* only anonymous, irreversible hashes are kept

Your privacy is respected at every step.

---

## **7. No Obligations or Employment Relationship**

Contributing does not make you an employee or contractor.

You are free to contribute (or stop contributing) at any time.
MayMeow Studio may accept or reject contributions for any reason.

---

## **8. Revocation**

If your contribution has **not** yet appeared in a public release, you may request its removal.
Once released, open-source licensing means it cannot be fully revoked.

---

## **9. Acceptance**

By submitting a contribution (including a pull request or your username hash),
you agree to the terms of this Contributor License Agreement.

Thank you for supporting and improving this project.
Your contributions help keep **MayMeow Studio** creative, fun, and alive. 💙
